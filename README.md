# Portfolio_Optimization
## Introduction
Portfolio Optimization Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods to predict rate of return. Then use the predicted date to build portfolio optimization models. 
## Problems to slove
- Tradtional Mean-Variance model use mean return as rate of return, but that's not suitable for short term investment;
- Nomal distuibution hypothesis is not always works in reality;
- Variance to stand the risk of investment is too roughly;
## Plan
- [] First use data of hs300 to test this method;
- Then more data of stocks will be used;
